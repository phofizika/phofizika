                    Dear reader, I am Xinyang and on behalf of the team I would like to extend a warm welcome to you. I assume that you are interested, at least a little bit, in physics and is why you are reading this blog right now. In this piece of write-up, I would like to share a little bit about why you might want to do Physics Olympiad and how you should go about doing it. Many of the ideas I share here actually come from my seniors, and I think they are very helpful in my journey. 
                    So, as you begin to read, I would like to ask you this question: why do you want to do Physics Olympiad? It might be for many reasons: I am good at physics; It is cool; I am too bored etc. Initially when I started, I didn’t have an answer too. I remember going to the first SJPO lesson conducted by my school and feeling completely lost as my seniors were teaching circuits that day. They threw us the famous cube resistor question and spent the entire lesson discussing. I wasn’t quite able to follow and after everyone left, I decided to stay back to clarify some doubts. The senior was nice enough to stay for 1 whole hour to work through the math with me (He used KVL). The working was very messy but he got it anyways. Just before we were done, he gave me another idea to the problem: by using equipotential points. I listened and noted down the idea and decided to go home and think about it. Honestly back then I doubted I could figure it out, but nevertheless I spent a few hours thinking and pondering on his words. Since imagining how the current flows is hard, I decided to draw some diagrams. As I played around, something managed to click and in no time I solved it. It is that moment I became found of the feeling of doing problems: the pure joy of thinking. As time progressed, I became better at it and started to use more difficult materials. Advancing to July last year, just before my school’s first round of training ended, another senior asked me the same question I am asking you now, why do PO. I told him I found it fun. This is honestly a great answer, but he provided an alternative. Imagine that you have obtain SPHO gold or IPHO gold, what would you feel? Ecstatic, proud? Definitely, but would these feelings of happiness last very long? I doubt so. These emotions are fleeting. So if not for the honour, then what? This question actually boils down to a deeper philosophical one: why we do anything in life. Well, obviously for happiness right? Well then what leads to happiness? For me, the answer is through helping others. It one of the only source of sustainable joy I can find. This is also the answer to that question: Doing PO allows you to help others. Maybe not exactly now, but with a sharpened mind you can do so in the future. This precisely why I cofounded this programme, with the goal of helping you with my knowledge. 
                    So, now you have an idea of why you like to do PO, how should go about doing it? Another senior once told me, studying physics should be 99% your job and 1% the teacher’s job. I truly agree with this view. Fortunately, for beginners, I would say a more reasonable radio would be 7:3. The trainers here would be providing 30% of what is required and the rest of that 100% needs to be done by you. Remember, teachers are always here to guide you, not lead you. The role of teachers is introduce the topic to you, and be there to navigate you through the problems you face. However, always give your all before seeking help. “No pain no gain”, right? 
                    So as you embark on this journey, remember learning is a virtue in itself. And also, don’t forget to have fun!
