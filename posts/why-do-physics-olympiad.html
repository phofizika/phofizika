                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    In Singapore, there are few systematic Physics Olympiad training programs to prepare students,
                    saturating the national teams with students from select few schools only. Project <strong>FIZIKA</strong> was
                    founded by a group of 3 JC2 students who were teammates on the 2025 APhO Singapore Team. We hope to make olympiad
                    education <strong>free, accessible, and effective for all students</strong> in Singapore, preparing them
                    for national competitions such as SJPO and SPhO, and even international competitions like the revered IPhO
                    and APhO. This project also serves as a community for people to discuss all things Physics, to
                    share and learn from each other.
